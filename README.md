# Conference-Toy
Make video conference your toy!

## What?
This project aims to make a tool that can change your appearance on a video conference.

It will have the following features:
* Capture video from a specified camera,
* Add accessories onto video, and/or
* Make the video a still picture,
* Implement a GUI that shows the resulting video, and
* Configure a webcam and have DingTalk/Zoom/WeMeet connect to it

Due to my platform limitation, this project will be available for **Windows Only**.
Feel free to fork this repository and implement support for other platforms ;)

## How?
I will be using **Python 3.7** and the following libraries:
* [opencv-python](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_gui/py_video_display/py_video_display.html)
* [pyvirtualcam](https://github.com/letmaik/pyvirtualcam)
